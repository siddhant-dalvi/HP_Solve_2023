# HP_Solve_2023

## Solution for Problem

## 1. Data Collection:
Identify and select relevant social media platforms where customers discuss HP printers.
Utilize social media APIs or web scraping techniques to collect posts or mentions related to HP printers.
Gather additional information such as timestamps, user profiles, and engagement metrics.

## 2. Text Classification and Named Entity Recognition:
Develop or employ pretrained models for text classification to categorize posts into sentiment types (complaint, suggestion, appreciation).
Use named entity recognition models to extract printer brand, model, features, and problems mentioned in the posts.
Knowledge Graph Construction:

## 3. Create a knowledge graph using a graph database or a suitable representation.
Define nodes for posts, printers, features, problems, and sentiments.
Establish relationships between nodes based on the associations extracted from the posts (e.g., MENTIONS, DISCUSSES, HAS_SENTIMENT).

## 4. Querying and Analysis:
Implement a querying mechanism to retrieve information from the knowledge graph.
Enable stakeholders to query the knowledge graph based on specific criteria (e.g., posts discussing Wi-Fi issues in a specific printer model or brand).
Analyze the extracted data to gain insights, identify trends, and inform decision-making processes.

## 5. Integration and Visualization:
Integrate the solution with existing systems, such as customer relationship management (CRM) platforms, to enhance customer service and support workflows.
Develop a user-friendly interface or dashboard to visualize the knowledge graph and query results.
Enable stakeholders to explore and analyze customer sentiments, feedback, and trends for better customer service, product improvement, and faster issue resolution.
